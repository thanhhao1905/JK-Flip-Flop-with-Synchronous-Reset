### Introduction: JK Flip-Flop with Synchronous Reset

This repository contains a Verilog implementation of a **JK flip-flop** with a **synchronous active-low reset**. This design is a fundamental building block in digital logic, widely used in various applications from sequential circuits to state machines.

#### What It Is

The `jk_ff_sync_rst_n` module is a core component of digital design. Itâ€™s a type of sequential logic circuit that can store a single bit of data. The key features of this implementation are:

* **JK Flip-Flop:** It operates based on the classic JK inputs, where `J` and `K` control the next state of the flip-flop.
* **Synchronous Reset:** Unlike an asynchronous reset, the reset operation (`rst_n`) is only effective on the rising edge of the clock signal (`clk`). This ensures a more predictable and stable system behavior, preventing race conditions and unexpected state changes.
* **Active-Low Reset:** The reset is activated when the `rst_n` signal is `0` (low). This is a common convention in many digital designs.

#### Key Features and Use Cases

The synchronous reset makes this flip-flop particularly useful in designs where precise timing and system stability are critical. It can be used for:

* **Creating State Machines:** As the fundamental memory element, it's essential for building counters and state registers in finite state machines (FSMs).
* **Implementing Sequential Logic:** This module is the basic building block for more complex sequential circuits like registers, shift registers, and dividers.
* **Robust Digital Systems:** The synchronous reset mechanism helps ensure that the entire system starts in a known, stable state, which is crucial for reliable operation and debugging.
